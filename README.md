## Research Overview: Space and Time Trade-offs in B-Trees

B-trees are self-balancing tree data structures designed to maintain sorted data and facilitate efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. One of the key advantages of B-trees is their ability to adapt to dynamic datasets and support large-scale storage systems with predictable performance characteristics.

In the context of space and time trade-offs, optimizing B-tree performance involves striking a balance between minimizing storage overhead and maximizing query efficiency. This trade-off is particularly crucial in scenarios where memory constraints or disk I/O limitations influence system performance.
